    "- the ability to use basic modelling syntax and structure and apply that to different model types\n",
    "- the wide variety of modelling infrastructure freely available\n",
    "- the large amounts of online community support to assist in model implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to use this project to explore these observations as applied to complex models. I would like to do this to see how much success can be obtained applying complex models particularly to a real-world dataset. There seems to be a bias to using pre-cleaned data (e.g. from Kaggle competitions) in model tutorials which results in artifically high model performance. I wanted to see if high model performance could be achieved on a dataset scraped from real-world pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of the project are therefore two-fold:\n",
    "- develop as high-performing dog breed image classifier as possible using real-world dataset.\n",
    "- following the observations above, assess the current landscape of freely available neural network modelling methods and their ease of implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics for success will therefore be split between the two goals:\n",
    "- develop a model which scores well on classifying dog breeds from images\n",
    "- successful implementation of a variety of neural network models and techniques"
